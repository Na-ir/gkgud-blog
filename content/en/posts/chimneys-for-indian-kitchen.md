### **1\. Types of Kitchen Chimneys**

There are 2 main types of kitchen chimneys that are classified based on installation. i.e. one is ducting chimney and the other is ductless. Here, we’re discussing about the working, and benefits of chimney type. Check it out!

**a) Ducting Chimney**

![chimney 2](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chimney-2-1-300x300.jpg)

The ducting or extracting chimneys work by sucking in the air from the kitchen and then passing it through filters and meshes that absorb the oils and grim from the air and releases the air outside through a pipe or PVC outlet.

**Pros**

*   Highly efficient to use.
*   Used for commercial kitchens.
*   Captures smoke, dust, fumes in high amounts.

**Cons**

*   Proper installation required.

**b) Ductless Chimney**

![chimney 1](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chimney-1-1-300x300.jpg)

Ductless or reducing chimneys work using a motor and a fan or blower. The air absorbed by the chimney is passed through charcoal filters that absorb heat, odor and smoke and release the clean air into the kitchen itself.

**Pros**

*   Easy to install and setup.
*   Programmed to turn-on/off automatically.

To conclude, ducted systems are more efficient than ductless because it has come with lot of settings and flexible options. For commercial kitchens its best to use ducted, whereas for residential purposes, you can prefer both.

### **2\. Different Types of Filters in Chimneys**

![Kitchen-Chimney-Guide](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kitchen-Chimney-Guide-Image-02-0504140005-1-300x264.jpg)

A filter is the main component of a kitchen chimney that purifies the air by filtering the oil particles, grime, dust and odor. There are 3 main types of filters based on the material used and construction.

*   **Mesh Filter/Cassette Filter**

![Cassette-filter](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cassette-filter-1.jpeg)

These types of filters are made by overlapping layers of aluminum mesh that have minute holes. As the air passes through this filter, the oil and grime gets caught in the pores. But the pores in mesh filters get obstructed soon and need to be cleaned every fortnight. If it is not properly cleaned, then suction power decreases and noise level increases. Chimneys with this filter require more maintenance than other types.

*   **Baffle Filter**

![Baffle-Filter](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Baffle-Filter-1.jpeg)

Baffle filter is a flow control panel that comes in multiple curve structures. It is made of steel or aluminum materials that help to alter the course of air. Chimneys with baffle filters are specially made for Indian kitchens.

This filter makes use of the ‘cut and slash’ innovative mechanism to separate oil and odor from the smoke. Further, the oil gets deposited on the layers of steel of aluminum but it does not affect the suction power of the chimney. It needs cleaning once every 2 to 3 months. Even if oil is collected within the filter layers, it will have minimum impact on suction power.

*   **Charcoal (Carbon) Filter**

![Charcoal-Filters](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Charcoal-Filters-1.jpeg)

Charcoal filters are also known as carbon filter. It comes with charcoal granules that deters odor from the smoke. The charcoal filter is an optional filter that comes in combination with a baffle filter or mesh filter. The holes in the charcoal carbon will absorb the oil, heat and smoke particles. Charcoal filters are not washable. You can replace this wonderful filter for every 3-6 months depending on the intensity of cooking. These filters are used mostly in ductless and expensive chimneys.

**Verdict:**

Among all the different types of chimney filters, baffle filters are the best for Indian cooking. Be it a traditional or modular kitchen, baffle filter can handle the regular Indian household cooking style which includes lots of masala and frying. And moreover, it requires less maintenance and easy to clean as well.

### **3\. Types of Chimney Hoods**

Size of the chimney determines the performance – if the chimney sizes is less than stove then it will not provide effective results. For example, 3ft gas stove requires at least 3ft chimney. Anything less than that will not provide proper justice to your needs. Most of the chimneys in India come in two different types – 60cm and 90cms. If you are confused which one to purchase, then below is a quick solution…

*   2 or 4 burner stove requires – 60cm kitchen chimney
*   3 to 5 burner stove requires – 90cm chimney

**Important Note:** While installing, make sure the distance between chimney and gas stove is between 65 – 75cms. If the distance is more than that, the effectiveness will reduce.

### **6\. Suction Power of the Chimney**

![Suction-Power](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Suction-Power-1-300x121.jpg)

The main aspect or principle on which a chimney works is – suction power. So, it is very important to consider this factor while making the purchase. If you are wondering how to know the right suction power, then there is a thumb rule – a chimney should be able to suck 10 times of air volume in the given space. In India, suction power is represented in cubic meter per hour.

A chimney with high suction power is powerful enough. Most of the kitchens in India are small, having an average of 48 cubic meters. So, the best suction power for any average Indian kitchen is 480 cubic meters per hour. 

The average suction power range available in Indian kitchen chimneys is from 400 cubic meters to 1250 cubic meters per hour. You should also consider distance between the vents, gas stove and others. If you want to know the right suction power, then here is the math rule for it. Measure the kitchen volume in cubic meters and then multiply it with 10 then results is what the suction power required. For example, kitchen volume is 40 cubic meters, then 40 multiplied by 10 is 400. So the suction required is 400 cubic meters.

### **7\. Auto Clean **

![ auto-clean](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/auto-clean-1-300x300.jpg)

In case of auto clean chimneys, the oil molecules are isolated by the filters so the chimney does not gets obstructed like ordinary chimneys. This in turn, improves the suction power of the chimney. Auto clean chimney collects all the oil in a specific compartment which can be taken out easily, cleaned and set back in. This function helps to time and effort.

### **8\. Noise**

The presence of motors in chimneys carries out the excess air circulation which results in noise. So, one must take noise into consideration while purchasing chimneys for home usage. Otherwise, you may feel bit irritation and uncomfortable due to the loud noise produced from the chimneys.

### **9\. Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning and maintenance of chimney is the most important thing that everyone must do to improve the performance and to last longer. As the functionality of the chimney is to remove smoke and dust present in the kitchen, needs constant washing as it gets stuck by debris.

If you find difficulty in cleaning the chimneys, then simple grab the one that comprises of detachable filters and auto-cleaning functionalities. It will automatically clean up the filters neatly and looks like a new one.

### **10\. Manufacturer Reputation and Warranty **

![warranty-seal](https://homezene.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/warranty-seal-icon-1.png)

Another important factor that you need to look into is the manufacturer’s reputation and warranty information. Most of the people do attract for branded models as they provide exceptional performance and also increases the lifespan of chimneys.

Besides, the manufacturer offers a warranty period of 1/2 years. Though it may vary from brand to brand, you can get it repaired for free of cost within the specified time. So, when you make a purchase, always check for the models that come with the warranty services.

### **11\. Price**

Amazon, Flip Kart and Snap deal are the major selling e-commerce sites in India. However, to sort of the best, you need to look into the features and price. They usually available at a price starting from 2,000/- and may vary depending on the size, functionality, durability and the upgraded features.

Have a close look at the products given in this article that is in your budget range and suitable for your home cooking requirements. If you can afford more on kitchen chimneys, my best suggestion is to go with the models that come with the advanced features to operate smartly.

**How Do Kitchen Chimneys Work?**
---------------------------------

Kitchen chimneys contain a hood which is usually mounted over countertop or gas stoves. Inside this appliance, a powerful fan is places which sucks the burnt gases and smoke and exhaust it out through a piped duct. Expelling smoke directly from above the gas stove is a better option than normal exhaust fan. As the oil fumes, smoke, masala fumes and cooking smells are sucked out immediately, you can work comfortably in the kitchen. And moreover, your kitchen will be free of grime and oil deposits.

**Which is better Auto Clean Chimney or Manual Clean Chimneys?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

Cleaning is one of the difficult tasks when it comes to chimneys. However, maintaining them clean is important to increase the life of a chimney. If you don’t like cleaning or don’t have much time to do it, then we recommend going for an auto-clean chimney.

Though the name itself represents the difference between the two types, it is better to know a little more about them before making the purchase. Below, we have mentioned the difference and working mechanism of these two types in detail.

*   **Auto-Clean Chimney**

When compared to other model, this one is considered as the best oil collector. When the cooking air passes through it, the oil collector present in it will collect most of the oil and grease. Chimneys with auto-clean feature require very less maintenance. You can just click the auto-clean button once in a week and be assured of cleaning. Apart from that, you have to clean the oil collector using general cleaning methods. This chimney is perfect heavy usage kitchens and for people who don’t have much time for cleaning chores.

*   **Manual Clean Chimney**

This model is a complete opposite of auto-clean chimney. Cleaning them requires a lot of patience and time. However, they last long and more durable if they are properly maintained. You have to clean these chimneys 2 or 3 times in a week. These are perfect for people who don’t have a lot of food as the cleaning will less and easy.

**Precautions to Consider While Using an Electric Chimney**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Kitchen chimneys are meant to remove smoke and odour emitted while cooking in the kitchen. However, if it is not properly cared or maintained, then the performance of the chimney will gradually decrease. Below are some of the important precautions to consider while using a kitchen chimney. If you follow these precautions, kitchen chimney will provide best performance every time.

*   **Stove and Hob distance:** While installing the appliance, make sure the stove and hob are placed at a minimum distance of 25 to maximum of 30 inches. Whatever might be the type of kitchen chimney (wall mounted, built-in hob or others), it is very important to maintain the distance.
*   **If distance Less:** If the distance between the stove and chimney is less than 26”, then there is a possibility of hood catching fire. For suppose, if the distance is less and gas is turned on without any utensil and the chimney is also turned on, then the fan may suck the flame and catch fire.
*   **If distance more:** Similarly, if the distance between the chimney bottom and gas-stove is more, then the chimney performance will decrease. It will not able to take away the smoke, heat and odour completely out of the kitchen. Because of the distance, the particles will spread in the air. So, in order to prevent any major consequences and let the chimney work at its peak, the distance should be between 26” to 30”.
*   **Voltage:** In order to provide better performance, kitchen chimneys should get exact voltage of power. Sometimes, a 2 phase voltage may not be enough for electric appliances to work at their best. So, it is better to have 3 phase voltage.
*   Before installing a kitchen chimney, make sure the house has proper earthing.
*   If you are using **a duct chimney**, then make sure to maintain a separate duct for smoke exhaustion. Avoid connecting or combining the duct to other smoke exhaustion appliances.
*   It is not recommended to leave the gas burners open. Most of the filters present in the kitchen chimney are flammable which may burn the chimney as well.
*   Avoid leaving frying pans unattended as the oil may catch fire.
*   Before even purchasing a kitchen hood, you should check out if there is any space or provision to install the duct kitchen chimney. For installing a kitchen chimney, you need a hole bigger than 6”. If it isn’t present, then you can request the dealers or installation service person to do the work for making a hole. However, this work would be charged extra money apart from the installation service.
*   **Chimney Pipe:** Along with the kitchen chimney, a 6 feet pipe is provided. If the duct hole is more than 6 feet length, then an additional pipe can be bought and fixed. Usually for Indian kitchen chimneys, 10 feet height is recommended. Even if the duct height is more then 10 (13 – 15 feet), then it is a much better option. However, it is better to have at least 6 to 8 feet of duct to maintain the performance and productivity.
*   When the duct is installed, make sure it has less numbers of bends or turns. If the bends are more, then the efficiency can be reduced and the noise level will be increased. The basic thumb rule is to have a maximum of 3 bends (90-degree bends). A good installation expert will never recommend more than 3 bends. However, if the bends are 45 degrees then 1 or 2 bends more will not be a problem. Some companies like SIMENS (a German company) specially notify to have only 2 bends for better performance. A third bend is prohibited by some companies. So, check with the dealer or brand’s customer service before making the installation.
*   Some companies have introduced flexible ducts concept using advanced technology. The standards length for the ducts of these companies is 3 meter with 3” to 18” inches in diameter. This flexible duct can be stretched to 3 times of its length and highly resistant to corrosion as well. However, check all the features, technologies and specifications before making the purchase.

**My chimney is making terrible noise, why?**
---------------------------------------------

The capacity and working quality of electric chimney depends on motor suction power – which is responsible for the noise as well. The higher suction power, the noise kitchen chimney will be. If you need a high suction power kitchen chimney, then you have to adjust with the noise.

### **What is the best way to reduce the noise made by an electric kitchen chimney?**

One of the best ways to prevent kitchen chimney noise is to switch it on 5 minutes before or after completion of cooking. So, that chimney can remove bad odour, smoke present in the kitchen without facing the noise. Apart from that, below are some other ways of reducing kitchen chimney noise…

*   To decrease the noise, make sure the duct has less number of bends or turns from the chimney to outside.
*   Some manufacturers have been manufacturing noise-free chimneys. In this type of chimney, the main noise source – motor pump is separate from appliance itself. The motor pump is placed outside of the kitchen to provide relief from noise while using it. However, this type of chimney is very few in the Indian market and quite expensive as well. Very few manufacturers have been developing this kind of electric kitchen chimneys.

 You can also go for a 3-way suction chimney as it removes leftover smoke by providing multiple suction outlets at different angles in the chimney hood. This lets the fumes be sucked out properly at different directions. As there are multiple inlets for the motor, a 3-way suction kitchen chimney has lesser pressure inside its hood so the noise gets much lesser. But 3-way chimneys are developed to increase the suction power of a motor, not to reduce the noise.

**Safety Tips to Consider While Installing a Stainless Steel Kitchen Hood**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing a stainless steel chimney hood is not a simple task as it requires special skill set. And most importantly, this job has to be carried out carefully with safety measures. Most of the chimney hoods are free standing hoods available in different sizes. Some of them can be attached to the wall while some of them to the wall. Some of the stainless steel kitchen hoods contain touch control, a digital display, LED or halogen light, automatic shut off and other bonus features. For comfortable and easy cleaning, some kitchen chimneys come with dishwasher safe grease filter. As the appliances are placed over the kitchen stove, you have to make sure the widths between them should be maintained. They can also be placed over the kitchen islands. Some of the other important safety measures while installing a stainless steel hood are mentioned below…

*   **Careful Handling**

Until it’s time, never remove the kitchen hood from the packaging. While removing it from the package, grab with fingers from the lower level. Avoid lifting by a utensil rail. It is better to wear cotton gloves and safety glasses while handling the appliance. The safety gloves ensure the hood doesn’t get damaged or scratched while being handled. Last but not least, never remove the plastic – remove it only after the installation process is completely.

*   **Prefer an Electrician**

Unless you have experience of installing electrical appliances, never attempt to do it by yourself. The electrical connections have to connected properly as per the functioning of the chimney. Disconnect the electrical supply until the chimney is completely installed. Apart from that, also make sure the hoot is power is off and doesn’t turn on the chimney automatically once it is fixed. Some kitchen chimneys have specific electrical wiring. If you aren’t aware of this, then it is better to call an electrician or experts. Apart from that, there are specific distance requirements to handle while installing the chimney, make sure to follow the required guidelines.

*   **Handling Proper Ventilation**

Never connect a kitchen chimney to a duct that has already been used previously. The ventilation flow must be proper as the hood’s main responsibility is to remove steam, odour and smoke. Adequate air supply is important to flow through the kitchen so better performance. The sucked air should not crawl into garages, spaces, or attics. The kitchen chimney ensures a pleasant smelling kitchen without smoke or oil deposits.

*   **Proper Hood Ducting**

Apart from proper ventilation, a hood must be properly ducted as well. Before even beginning for duct work, know exactly where the duct should be placed. It is always recommended to install the ducts outside the house. If the ducts are placed inside the kitchen or home, then it may remove the odour but it will push back the heat and smoke into the house. If the filters of kitchen chimney are not properly cleaned, then the odours may get circulated within the home. Additional cleaning process may become a hassle

**What is the appropriate way to cover up the chimney pipe?**
-------------------------------------------------------------

Kitchen vent pipe is a very important part of a chimney to dispose the steam, heat, smoke and odour sucked out by the chimney. Its presence may be a little inappropriate to your interiors. Instead of moving it, we recommend some concealing design options for you. We have mentioned some of the techniques below that literally cover the pipe with some creativity.

*   **Columns**

One of the simple ways to cover up a kitchen vent is to hide it inside a column or soffit. You can create a soffit by placing boards around the sides of pipe and attaching them to the wall. Based on your kitchen décor, you can choose the texture and type of wood or dry wall. Once pipe is boxed up, you can paint or stain according to your remaining cabinetry. Another way to conceal a pipe, it is better to purchase a prefabricated column which is bit larger in diameter than the vent pipe.

*   **Cabinets**

Based on the length of pipe and how it is installed on the wall, you can build a false cabinet to conceal the presence of vent pipe. Some kitchen design outlets and building careers provide backless and prefabricated cabinets that match your present cabinets. A cut above and below will be open for the pipe to pass through. These openings are at least one inch wider than the pipe’s diameter. Other option is to increase the height of cabinets along the pipe. It not only conceals the ugly pipe but also provides additional storage.

*   **Paints and Accessories**

If the orientation or layout of the cabinets are a hurdle to cover up the vent pipe, then the only way is to draw away the eye away. Painting the pipe with same colour as cabinets or walls or consider adding decorative elements like hanging baskets, art, plants are some of the ways to take away the attention from the vent pipe. Though these wont completely seal the pipe, the attention will be taken away.
