### **Types of water heaters-storage capability**

If water heaters are classified into two parts - storage geyser and tankless - based on storage capacity

*   **Water heater & Storage Geyser**

When you switch on the water heater to heat water, a certain amount of water is heated and stored in the water heater. The water temperature is maintained through a certain amount of thermostat.

Two types of water heater are available in the market which  
Made of stainless steel and copper. Steel tanks are expensive, long-lasting, and require little maintenance.

Copper tanks are even more expensive, although they work very well. Different models come with different capabilities, you can buy according to your requirement.

### **The material of the Water Tank**

Typically, materials used for water tank heaters are either copper, thermoplastic or stainless steel. These materials ensure efficiency and safe output.

*   **Copper:** It is one of the most used materials to build tanks for water heaters. As copper is a good conductor of heat you can get a quick response in heating the water.
*   **Stainless steel:** Commonly used in most of the modern-day water heaters, stainless steel tanks are usually coated with anti-corrosive powder and glass lining to keep the tank free from corrosion and other electrochemical reactions.
*   **Thermoplastic:** However, thermoplastic tanks have a better non-corrosive feature when compared to copper. On the downside, they are not insulated.

### **Type of Geysers** ,**Electric geysers**,**Gas geysers** **&** **Solar Geysers**

*   **Electric geysers:**

As the name hints, these geysers consume electricity for providing hot water. The working principle of electric geysers is actually very simple – electric energy is converted into heat through heating elements to increase the temperature.

These water heaters are perfect for people living in apartments, homes, and rented houses.

*   **Gas geysers**

The gas geyser is always more efficient which uses fuel. These geysers have no power of their own. These geysers for heating water provide a continuous flow of hot water and provide instant heating. Gas geysers are less efficient than electric geysers and have a quicker recovery.

No wonder they are a good choice for large families. And if the geysers are not protected with good quality material, then there is little concern about safety. It cannot lasting more than 6-7  years.

Much affordable operation and maintenance costs. At least 66% of maintenance costs can be saved.

Unlimited supply of instant hot water without any limitation, with just one turn of the tap

*   **Solar Geysers**

  
A solar water heater is a storage-tank water heater that uses solar energy to fulfill the hot water concept in a home. If you live in a village or you have a large area in the city, then solar geysers are the best option for you.

You have a good chance of saving money with this option. There is no need to be electric or gas frantic to provide hot water for the whole family. Solar water heaters are not suitable for apartments and remnants.

Some of the Geyser for a home present in the market also work on gas or electricity as a backup for emergency purposes. The only For the installation of solar panels, more space should be like a roof and open Also these appliances may not be effective in winters and monsoons when sunshine is very little.

Good

Bad

Much expensive than electric gas heaters

To install solar panels, it needs a roof-like area

Available in larger capacities like 100 liters. So suitable for only large families

### **Anti-Scale And Anti Corrosive**

When purchasing a geyser, it is very important to note whether the water tank has an anti-corrosive and anti-scale lining. Before that, analyze whether the water in your area is hard or soft. In some parts of India, water quality is extremely poor.

### **Insulation**

Most modern water tank heaters have a smart feature - automatic shutdown. Sometimes, people forget to turn off the water heater, but the automatic shutdown survives the water tank heater. In such situations, this factor is beneficial. It helps to turn off the geyser by preventing unnecessary power consumption.

### **Power Consumption**

Electric water heaters add up to 15% of your monthly electricity bill depending on weather conditions and consumption. Depends on your uses

All branded water heaters are BEE rated. Look at the BEE label and study the annual electricity consumption in the purchase and units.

### **Wattage**

Geyser for home Typically, electric water heaters are the best and operate at 1500–2000 watts. Some branded geysers come with an increased power of up to 3000 watts in the market which draws more power for a short time.

Geysers with higher flow rates (100L / hr) will draw more power than water heaters with lower flow rates.

### **Ratings**

All water heaters are marked with a BEE Star rating by the Government of India. For Example Geyser for home, Geyser for kitchen, Geyser for hard water, Geyser for bathroom & Geyser for spare parts. Higher the number of stars (on a scale of 5), the more energy-efficient the device is. Star rating is something one has to consider in order to save money and time in the long run.

A 5-star rating geyser is more energy-efficient and works on much lesser electricity than a geyser with a 4-star rating. Always consider buying any home appliance with a 4 or higher star rating.

### **Material**

Now that we know the importance of the material used in building the inner tank, let us look at the limitations set in building the outer body. The outer body is made using high-level plastic. However, sturdy material such as ABS is preferred. The plastic even helps in molding the heater to the desired shape and design.

### **Extra Features**

It is always good to have some additional features such as a good design, stretchable knob, and others to make the bathing experience more comfortable easier. Our body cannot handle too hot water, so you don’t require hot water that exceeds 50 degrees Celsius.

That is why it is better to have customized heat temperature adjustment in a geyser. This will prevent the struggle of mixing hot and cold water to get desirable hotness. And moreover, it saves electricity bill as well.

### **Geyser** **Maintenance**

the maintenance of the geyser depends on geyser type and frequent usage. To maintain the geyser in good working condition, clean the tank once every week to prevent rusting.

### Always **Purchased a good bra**nded geyser

Geysers are one of the important household appliances. When you buy a new one, it is always advisable to purchase from a popular brand that offers quick repairs and replacements in case any damage occurs.

### **Expense**

Though we have considered this factor in the last, it is equally important to others provided in the buying guide. If you’re on low-budget, go with the entry-level models that best match your heating or storage requirements. Otherwise, go with top-notch water geysers that come at expensive rates.
